# What is a Design Pattern
**The design patterns are solutions to given problems**

###### The advantages of design patterns are as follows:
- they are usable across multiple projects
- the architectural level of problems can be solved
- they are time-tested and well-proven
- they have reliability and dependence

###### Classifyng patterns
There are 23 design patterns, classified under three main categories:
- **Creational Patterns**, 
they work on th basis of how objects can be created, isolating the details of object creation.
An example of creational pattern is the *Singleton pattern*

- **Structural Patterns**, 
  They design the structure of objects and classes so they can compose to achieve larger results.
  The focus is on simplifyng the structure and identifying the relationship between classes and objects.
  An example of structural pattern is the Adapter pattern

- **Behavional Patterns**, 
  They are concerned with the interactio among objects and responsibility of objects.
  Objects should be able to interact and still be loosely coupled

  An example of behavioral pattern is Observer Pattern.
